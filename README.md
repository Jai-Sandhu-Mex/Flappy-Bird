# Flappy-Bird
**Flappy Bird Game in Java** 🐦🎮
Welcome to my Flappy Bird game project, built in Java! This project is a fun recreation of the classic game where the player controls a bird trying to fly between pipes without hitting them.

**Project Overview** 📋
This project was inspired by Kenny Yip Coding's YouTube tutorial, which provides a clear step-by-step guide to developing the game. It covers key concepts such as:

1. Game Loop: Implementing continuous game updates and rendering.
2. Collision Detection: Ensuring the bird interacts correctly with the pipes and ground.
3. Object-Oriented Design: Using classes and objects for organizing game components.


**Features** 🌟
1.Smooth game mechanics and controls.
2. Simple graphics and physics.
3. Score tracking as you progress through the pipes.
