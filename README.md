# Flappy Bird Game in Java 🐦🎮

Welcome to my **Flappy Bird** game project, built in Java! This project is a fun recreation of the classic game where the player controls a bird trying to fly between pipes without hitting them.

## Project Overview 📋

This project was inspired by **Kenny Yip Coding's** YouTube tutorial, which provides a clear step-by-step guide to developing the game. It covers key concepts such as:
- **Game Loop:** Implementing continuous game updates and rendering.
- **Collision Detection:** Ensuring the bird interacts correctly with the pipes and ground.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Using classes and objects for organizing game components.

## Features 🌟
- Smooth game mechanics and controls.
- Simple graphics and physics.
- Score tracking as you progress through the pipes.
